# Algorithm Used : K means
It's an unsupervised machine learning algorithm.

This groups the unlabeled dataset into different clusters.

# Libraries
Matplotlib

Numpy

Pandas

# Methodology
Data Preprocessing:

Data cleaning and preparation (e.g., handling missing values, normalizing data).
Feature selection and extraction for customer segmentation.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizing the distribution of customers, age categories,income , and spending patterns

Clustering:

Applying K-Means clustering to group customers into meaningful segments.
Using the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.

# Results
Cluster Visualization:

The clustering visualization identified distinct customer groups based on two key features: Annual Income and Purchase Rating.
The scatter plot demonstrates that customers were grouped into 4 clusters with each cluster showing a unique distribution pattern.
Cluster Interpretations:

Cluster 1 (Blue): Customers in this group have moderate to high annual income but a low purchase rating, indicating they might not be satisfied with the products or services.
Cluster 2 (Red): Represents customers with relatively low income but high purchase ratings, suggesting a high level of satisfaction despite lower spending power.
Cluster 3 (Green): This cluster contains high-income customers who also gave high purchase ratings, making them the most valuable segment for the business.
Cluster 4 (Magenta): Consists of low-income customers with low purchase ratings, suggesting a need for attention to this group or that they are not a priority market.
Centroid Interpretation:

The centroids of the clusters represent the average customer profile within each cluster. This can help in understanding the general characteristics of each group and in forming marketing or product strategies.
Key Insights:

The segmentation reveals that customer satisfaction (measured by purchase rating) doesnâ€™t necessarily correlate with income. High-purchase ratings are found in both low and high-income groups.
